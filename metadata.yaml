description: "Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town is a sequence of stories by Stephen\
  \ Leacock, first published in 1912. It is generally considered to be one of the\
  \ most enduring classics of Canadian humorous literature. The fictional setting\
  \ for these stories is Mariposa, a small town on the shore of Lake Wissanotti. Although\
  \ drawn from his experiences in Orillia, Ontario, Leacock notes: \"Mariposa is not\
  \ a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty of them. You may find\
  \ them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and\
  \ the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels.\"\nThis work has remained\
  \ popular for its universal appeal. Many of the characters, though modelled on townspeople\
  \ of Orillia, are small town archetypes. Their shortcomings and weaknesses are presented\
  \ in a humorous but affectionate way. Often, the narrator exaggerates the importance\
  \ of the events in Mariposa compared to the rest of the world. For example, when\
  \ there is a country-wide election, \"the town of Mariposa, was, of course, the\
  \ storm centre and focus point of the whole turmoil.\"\nThe story of the steamboat\
  \ Mariposa Belle sinking in Lake Wissanotti is one of the best-loved in the set.\
  \ The apparent magnitude of this accident is lessened somewhat when it is revealed\
  \ that the depth of the water is less than six feet. Men from the town come to the\
  \ rescue in an un-seaworthy lifeboat which sinks beneath them just as they are pulled\
  \ onto the steamer, and the narrator earnestly remarks that this was \"one of the\
  \ smartest pieces of rescue work ever seen on the lake.\"\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC\
